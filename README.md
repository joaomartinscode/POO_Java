# Java OOP Learning Projects

This repository contains practical Java projects and exercises developed as part of my university course in Object-Oriented Programming (POO). The goal is to practice and deepen understanding of core OOP concepts through hands-on coding assignments.

## üß† Purpose

The main objective of this project is to reinforce concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Abstraction and Interfaces
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Constructors, Methods, and Overloading

## üìÅ Project Structure

All code is located in the `src/` directory, organized into packages based on topics or assignments. Each file demonstrates specific OOP principles in action.


## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joaomartinscode/POO_Java.git
   cd POO_Java
   
2. Open with an IDE:
Recommended: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Alternatively, compile and run via command line using javac and java

3. Explore different class files under src/ to see OOP in practice.
